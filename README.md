Lua module to handle Halo Custom Edition game engine on runtime

## What is lua-blam?
Is a Lua module for scripting that allows you to handle Halo Custom Edition memory as objects
(tables) in your script, it also includes some features as API extension and unification between
Chimera and SAPP.

## What is intended for?
LuaBlam aims to make easier and more understandable scripts providing simple syntax and accessible
API functions making a standard for game memory editing.

## Why should I use it?
Scripting with raw low level functions to edit memory can lead to undesirable situations where you
can introduce lot of harmful errors if you are not careful enough to maintain your code secure and
continuously tested, also readability for your code is key when it comes to open source scripts or
collaborative work, lua-blam is perfect for both, keeping all the memory handling isolated and tested
separately and helping developers to write simpler and understandable code with good abstraction.

## Highlights
- Simple to implement and simple to learn
- Highly customizable
- Cross-platform (Chimera, SAPP)
- In code documentation
- Auto completion (using [EmmyLua](https://github.com/EmmyLua) via [Sumneko's Lua Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua))

## Scripting using lua-blam:
```lua
-- Make current player invisible with flashlight key
local player = blam.biped(get_dynamic_player())
if player then
    if player.flashlightKey then
        player.invisible = true
    end
end
```

## Scripting WITHOUT lua-blam:
```lua
-- Make current player invisible with flashlight key
local playerAddress = get_dynamic_player()
if playerAddress then
    local player = get_object(playerAddress)
    if player then
        local playerFlashlightKey = read_bit(player + 0x208, 8)
        if playerFlashlightKey == 1 then
            write_bit(player + 0x204, 4, 1)
        end
    end
end
```

## Visual Studio Code Integration with [Sumneko's Lua Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua):![lua-blamvscode](https://i.imgur.com/Ai2SuFH.gif)

## Installation
Place a copy of the `blam.lua` file in the project folder of your script to enable autocompletion,
to use this module on Halo Custom Edition you need to place the `blam.lua` on the lua modules
of your chimera folder `My Games\Halo CE\chimera\lua\modules`, however if you want to distribute your
script with this module builtin you can take a look at bundling modular lua scripts using
[Mercury](https://github.com/Sledmine/Mercury).

## Documentation
As mentioned above lua-blam provides in code documentation, basically by using EmmyLua all the
documentation needed can be found via autocompletion of the IDE.

Give a look to the examples folder in this repository for real use cases and examples of how to use implement lua-blam.

There is a documentation for Chimera Lua scripting on this repository, also a Changelog is
hosted here:

- [Chimera Lua API Documentation](docs/CHIMERA_LUA.md)
- [ARCHIVED - SAPP Documentation](archive/SAPP_DOCS_2.5.pdf)
- [ARCHIVED - Chimera Lua API Documentation](archive/CHIMERA_LUA_DOCS_2_X_X.pdf)
- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)
